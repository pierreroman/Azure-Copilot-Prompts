   ```
   Summarize <CVEID>.
   ```

2. **Show which technologies are impacted by the vulnerability**:
   ```
   Give me a bulleted list of the technologies that are susceptible to this vulnerability.
   ```

3. **Get more information about the known information for this CVE**:
   ```
   If there are TI articles related to this CVE, provide a list and summary of them & include links.
   ```

4. **Provide more information about the threat actors**:
   ```
   Are there any threat actors known to be associated with this CVE? If so, summarize what we know about them.
   ```

5. **Provide recommendations for better securing the environment against the impact of the CVE**:
   ```
   What mitigations can I put in place to defend against <CVEID>?
   ```

6. **Provide a report**:
   ```
   Write me an executive summary report for the vulnerability, threat actor insights, and recommendations for someone who is less technical.
   ```


These prompts are designed to guide Copilot for Security through a *Vulnerability impact assessment* within an environment, from initial identification to detailed reporting. Remember to tailor these prompts to fit the specific context and systems of your organization.
