# Threat actor profile

Required Plugin(s): *General*

To create a *Threat actor profile* in an environment using Copilot for Security, you could use the following series of prompts:

1. **Research a threat actor profile**:
   ```
   Give me a profile summary of <THREATACTORNAME>.
   ```

2. **Display any known TTPs**:
   ```
   Are there known TTPs for this threat actor?
   ```

3. **Produce more information with links to research**:
   ```
   If there are TI articles related to this threat actor, provide a list and summary of them & include links.
   ```

4. **Recommend how to protect the environment against the actor**:
   ```
   If there were TI articles found, what recommendations does the first article in the list have for protecting against this actor?
   ```

5. **Create a report**:
   ```
   Summarize the threat actor, TTPs, and recommendation insights into an executive report. It should be suitable for a less technical audience.
   ```


These prompts are designed to guide Copilot for Security through a *Threat actor profile* within an environment, from initial identification to detailed reporting. Remember to tailor these prompts to fit the specific context and systems of your organization.
